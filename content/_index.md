# ⚡️ About Me

👾 I’m Adler Medrado - also known as __spacexnu__.

Software Engineer with 20+ years writing code, defending systems, and staying ahead of hype.

My journey began on a BBS I built in the 90s on a PC/AT 386 running MS-DOS. That mindset still drives everything I do: build it yourself, understand every layer, stay sovereign.

I've architected and deployed systems across finance, e-commerce, and healthcare. Always with security, privacy, and performance in mind.

Currently working on AI-powered log analysis, NLP-based data extraction, and decentralized, censorship-resistant tools.

I’m also building [FraudTalon](https://fraudtalon.com)—an AI-powered platform that detects phishing, scams, and online fraud in emails, images, and URLs—created after too many “is this real?” questions from my family and friends.

All while finishing a History degree and staying deeply embedded in hacker culture.
