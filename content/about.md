## What I do

- Architect and deploy systems across finance, e-commerce, and healthcare with security, privacy, and performance as defaults.
- Build AI-powered tooling for log analysis and NLP-based data extraction.
- Design decentralized, censorship-resistant tools that keep people sovereign.

## Currently

- Building [FraudTalon](https://fraudtalon.com), an AI-powered platform that detects phishing, scams, and online fraud in emails, images, and URLs.
- Exploring local and cloud AI stacks to keep defenses close to the metal.
- Finishing a History degree while staying embedded in hacker culture.

## Origin story

My journey started on a BBS I ran in the 90s on a PC/AT 386 with MS-DOS. That DIY spirit still drives everything I do: build it yourself, understand every layer, stay sovereign.
