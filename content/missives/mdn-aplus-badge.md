![MDN A+ badge](/missives/images/badge-aplus.png)

Ran my site through [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)â€™s security scanner and kept tweaking until I hit [120/100 (A+)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/analyze?host=adlermedrado.com.br).

Checked the [scan history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/analyze?host=adlermedrado.com.br#history) and the very first one, back in 2018, scored 20/100 (F).

**Always improving.**
