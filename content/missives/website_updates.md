This website used to run on Cloudflare Pages. And being 100% honest with my visitors: I had all analytics disabled.  
But I still wanted to know more about my traffic without compromising anyone’s privacy.

So I migrated everything to my own VPS. Now I use nothing but raw logs + [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io) to understand what’s going on.  
No JavaScript tracking, no fingerprinting, no big tech spy bullshit.

Nginx logs + GoAccess = enough intel to know what’s happening, without selling anyone out.
