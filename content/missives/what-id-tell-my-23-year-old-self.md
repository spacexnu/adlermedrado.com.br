If I could whisper to my 23-year-old self, I’d tell him this:

* Stop wasting time worrying about what people think.
* Pour your energy into building, into creating, into making something that’s yours.
* And never forget: everything is impermanent — every victory, every failure, every storm.

That truth alone is enough to keep you moving forward.
