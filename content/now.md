## 📚 Reading

- *Ghost in the Wires* by Kevin Mitnick

## 🎧 Listening

Mostly grunge, fusion, and everything in between. Here’s what’s been on repeat:

### 🎸 Grunge / Alt Rock
- *Little Dogs* – Mudhoney  
  _Raw and fuzzy — classic Mudhoney energy with that garage spirit._
- *Good Enough* – Mudhoney  
  _Sludgy riffs with a melancholic groove._
- *Grease Box* – TAD  
  _Heavy, primal, and underrated. The sound of a band that should've exploded._
- *I’ll Stick Around* – Foo Fighters  
  _Dave Grohl’s rage in motion — a post-Nirvana declaration._
- *All I Want*, *The End of Something*, *Starve* – Rollins Band  
  _Relentless, emotional, physical. Rollins shouting from the gut._
- *The Regulator* – Clutch  
  _Southern sludge meets storytelling — slow-burn masterpiece._

### 🎶 Fusion / Instrumental
- *Boat Gig* and the rest of the *Face First* album – Tribal Tech  
  _Jazz fusion with surgical precision. Scott Henderson’s guitar is on fire._
- *LL3*, *Crushing* – moe.  
  _Improvisational rock that borders on psychedelic jazz._
- *Mokuba* – Tauk  
  _Funky, groovy, modern fusion — rich textures and clean chops._
- *Slant* – Mark Lettieri  
  _Slick, modern guitar work. Fusion meets funk meets cinematic._
- *Sigma Oasis* – Phish  
  _Laid-back jam vibes with that signature Phish atmosphere._
- *Bad Asteroid* – The Aristocrats  
  _Technical but fun. Fusion shredders having a blast._

### 🌍 World / Folk / Ethnic
- *Mongolian Folk Music (Throat Singing)* – Batzorig Vaanchig  
  _Hauntingly deep and powerful — a direct line to the spirit of the steppe._
- *Latvian Folk Music* – Auli  
  _Bagpipes and drums reimagined — tribal, hypnotic, proud._
- *Dieci Ragazze* – Lucio Battisti  
  _Italian pop from a different era — catchy, lighthearted, retro charm._
