# 🛠️ Which Tools Do I Use

If you’re curious about the tools I use to work, create, write, or simply survive the digital chaos — you’re in the right place.

This is a living document I update from time to time.  
Inspired by Wes Bos’ [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) project.

## ⚙️ Daily Workflow

Tools that power my day-to-day — whether I’m writing code, answering emails, or navigating the system.

- **Browser**
  - Safari — my main browser for daily usage
  - Brave — mostly for Nostr usage
- **Apple Mail** — old-school, but essential
- **Notes app** — for quick thoughts, task lists, project ideas
- **Enpass** — a password manager, because remembering everything is a trap
- **Alfred + Apple Shortcuts** — for quick actions, workflows, and automation
- **iTerm2** — my terminal of choice
- **Fish Shell** — recently moved from ZSH, and enjoying the experience
