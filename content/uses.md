## 🛠️ Which Tools Do I Use

If you’re curious about the tools I use to work, create, write, or simply survive the digital chaos - you’re in the right place.

This is a living document I update from time to time.  
Inspired by Wes Bos’ [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) project.

## ⚙️ Daily Workflow

Tools that power my day-to-day - whether I’m writing code, answering emails, or navigating the system.

- **Browser**
  - Safari - my main browser for daily usage
  - Brave - mostly for Nostr usage
- **Apple Mail** - old-school, but essential
- **Notes app** - for quick thoughts, task lists, project ideas
- **Spotlight ~~Alfred~~ + Apple Shortcuts** - for quick actions, workflows, and automation
- **Apple Terminal** - giving a new chance ~iTerm2 - my terminal of choice~
- **ZSH** After experimenting with Fish, I reverted to Zsh to maintain a more standardized system setup ~~Fish Shell - recently moved from ZSH, and enjoying the experience~~
