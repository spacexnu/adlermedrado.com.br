Being able to split the payments and get it for a ridiculously good price was the icing on the cake. <strong>It’s not some overhyped, flashy machine full of unnecessary specs - but putting my hands on a device that turns into a powerful tool with a bit of care and intention brought me genuine joy</strong>.</p><p>And that feeling connects directly to who I’ve always been. It’s not just “BBS-era nostalgia” — it’s continuity. Back then everything was manual: taking hardware apart on the kitchen table, tweaking cables, configuring IRQs, testing settings until they stopped complaining, and pushing through even when nothing made sense. It was stubbornness and freedom. Today the cables look different, but the spirit hasn’t changed at all.</p><p>That’s why I decided to make this laptop the cornerstone of a new phase of my personal infrastructure. Ubuntu, Debian, GNOME, and that whole “corporate-woke” aesthetic disguised as technical progress — all of that stays behind. I’m tired of the veneer. I want a system that actually respects its operator.</p><img height=50% src=/posts/images/my-site-on-tor.png width=50%><p>The choice was obvious: <a href=https://opensuse.org>openSUSE</a>, headless, clean, straight to the point.</p><p>Minimal install, no graphical interface, no fluff, no digital babysitting. That old familiar feeling of watching a system boot fast, lean, and efficient — exactly how it’s supposed to be.</p><p>And the first mission for this machine? Putting my personal website on the Tor network.</p><p>The whole process was genuinely fun. Not because I felt like I was reliving the 90s, but because it reignited an old mindset: focus, silence, one step at a time — test, adjust, repeat. It’s almost like a technical precision exercise with a very modern purpose.</p><p>And I didn’t do any of this just for the challenge. Privacy and digital sovereignty aren’t slogans to me; they’re principles I live by.</p><p>From the beginning, my website has followed this philosophy:</p><ul><li>No JavaScript</li><li>No analytics</li><li>No cookies</li><li>No tracking</li></ul><p>Pure, static HTML, GPG-signed for anyone who wants to inspect and verify it.</p><p>And now it’s also available as a .onion service, so anyone can access it anonymously — no intermediaries, no surveillance, no fingerprinting, none of the clutter and nonsense that plagues today’s web.</p><p>It’s the internet the way it should be: direct, quiet, and free.</p><p>And this computer isn’t stopping here. It’s going to host more services, more experiments, more layers of independence. It will become a small node of sovereignty inside my home — just like the improvised servers I used to build back when everything was dial-up and late nights.</p><p>In the end, nothing’s really changed. I’m still building in the dark, with the same stubborn 1994 spirit — only now with far better tools.</p><p>PS: Over the next few weeks, the Tor version of the site might go offline from time to time, since the machine isn’t in its final location yet. If it’s unreachable when you try, just give it another shot later.</p><p>Ah, the address is: <a href=http://xlqlev6ixhge3wyoivxhpcvuv2v5it2m2dxjnfng5d66jb7c6kpv6qid.onion>http://xlqlev6ixhge3wyoivxhpcvuv2v5it2m2dxjnfng5d66jb7c6kpv6qid.onion</a></p><p>Libertas Invicta.</p></div></div></article><div><div><div><a href=https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/verificar-assinaturas/>&#8592; Como verificar as assinaturas do meu site</a>
