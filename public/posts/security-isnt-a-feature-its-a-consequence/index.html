Security gets added later. If it gets added at all. Usually after something breaks or someone screams.</p><p>But here’s the truth nobody wants to hear:
Security starts with architecture.
Bad design choices turn into breach reports.
Ambiguous boundaries become exposed surfaces.</p><p>Adding 2FA or encrypting data doesn’t fix a system that was built wide open from day one.
It’s not about tools. It’s about thinking clearly at the start.</p><p>You want to ship fast?
Then plan for failure from day zero.
Draw a threat model. Think like an attacker before the attacker shows up.</p><h2 id=ask-yourself>Ask yourself:</h2><ul><li>What happens when someone hits the edge of the system?</li><li>What if they use it exactly as intended, but with malicious intent?</li><li>What happens when your logs are empty and you have to explain what went wrong?</li></ul><p>How your system behaves under pressure, under abuse, under intelligent attack — that’s not a rare edge case.
That’s reality.</p><h3 id=security-isnt-a-feature>Security isn’t a feature.</h3><p>It’s the side effect of building like you actually give a damn.</p><p><strong>If you think this kind of thinking is “too much”, wait until you read your own postmortem.</strong></p></div></div></article><div><div><div><a href=https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/verificador-de-url/>&#8592; Vou construir meu próprio verificador de URLs</a>
