I wrote my first software using turbo pascal. Was a kind of calendar software for my BBS.
I already have practice in Karate, Kung-fu and Kickboxing. I have fought in some kung-fu championships and gained some
medals.
Jewish is my religion.
I like to study history and military issues as a hobby.
I like to cook. Tabule and macarroni(pasta) are my specialities.
In 1994 I was interviewed and I had my photo in the first page of the Correio Braziliense (a local newspaper). It was
a reportage about BBS.
I have already lived in several Brazilian cities in the states of PR, DF, PE, SP and RJ. Some people call me a
gypsy. :)

Now i will tag another brazilian guys."><meta property="og:url" content="https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/seven-things/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Adler Medrado's corner of the web"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:image" content="/images/default-og-image.png"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:title content="Seven things that probably you may not know about me"><meta name=twitter:description content="This is the first time I take part a meme/tag, as it was my friend Rafael Dohms who invited me, I will
