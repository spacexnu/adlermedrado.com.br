I wrote my first software using turbo pascal. Was a kind of calendar software for my BBS.
I already have practice in Karate, Kung-fu and Kickboxing. I have fought in some kung-fu championships and gained some

Jewish is my religion.
I like to study history and military issues as a hobby.
I like to cook. Tabule and macarroni(pasta) are my specialities.
In 1994 I was interviewed and I had my photo in the first page of the Correio Braziliense (a local newspaper). It was
a reportage about BBS.
I have already lived in several Brazilian cities in the states of PR, DF, PE, SP and RJ. Some people call me a
gypsy. :)
