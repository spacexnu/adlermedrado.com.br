The world outside fully operational.</p><p>Inside the house, though, there was a different tempo.</p><p>I would drop my backpack near the door, grab something quick to eat, and press play.</p><p>That hour — somewhere between childhood and whatever came next — felt suspended.</p><p>Not quite a child anymore.
Not yet someone the world could pressure.</p><p>On that tape there was:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGnKpE4NCI&amp;pp=ygUebWV0YWxsaWNhIG5vdGhpbmcgZWxzZSBtYXR0ZXJz">Metallica</a> - <em>Nothing Else Matters</em></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQbPtJ7_Bk">The Simpsons</a> - <em>Do the bartman</em></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcUza_wWCfA">The Cure</a> - <em>The Lovecats</em></li></ul><p>When Nothing Else Matters started, the world slowed down.</p><p>There’s something about hearing vulnerability at an age when you’re still pretending not to feel too much.</p><p>Back then, I didn’t know what pressure was.
I didn’t know what leadership dysfunction looked like.
I didn’t know how environments could slowly erode your confidence.</p><p>I just knew that when that guitar began, everything felt stable.</p><p>Looking back, I realize something.</p><p>I wasn’t just listening to music.
I was absorbing posture.
Tone.
Emotional permission.</p><p>That quiet intro was teaching a young mind that strength didn’t always need to be loud.</p><p>Fast forward decades.</p><p>Life happened.</p><p>Corporate pressure.
Toxic leadership.
Years of performance measured by someone else’s scale.</p><p>At some point, I felt cracked.</p><p>Not destroyed.
Just stretched too far away from something essential.</p><p>And then one day, I remembered that tape.</p><p>I played the song again.</p><p>Not to escape.
But to check something.</p><p>Was that version of me still there?</p><p>He was.</p><p>And now, in 2026, I find something strangely familiar in a very different place.</p><p>Late at night, after the noise of the day fades, I log into <a href=https://dayz.com>DayZ</a>.</p><p>A cold map.
A ruined city.
Silence broken only by wind and distant footsteps.</p><p><strong>It’s a survival game.</strong></p><p>But it feels like something else.</p><p>It feels like that same suspended hour at 1 p.m.</p><p>No corporate hierarchy.</p><p>No performance review. No politics. Just awareness. Presence. Breathing.</p><p>Moving carefully through a hostile world and staying alive.</p><p>The VHS tape taught me that vulnerability and strength could coexist.</p><p>DayZ reminds me that calm and danger can coexist too.</p><p>Both are rituals.</p><p>Both are pauses.</p><p>Both are ways of stepping outside systems that try to define your worth.</p><p>Maybe we think someone broke us.</p><p>But maybe we were just stretched too far away from the boy who once pressed play at 1 p.m. and felt steady.</p><p>The technology changed.</p><p>The room changed.</p><p>The battlefield changed.</p><p>But the need for a ritual that restores balance never did.</p><p>Sometimes healing isn’t about fixing damage.</p><p>It’s about remembering who you were before you needed armor.</p><p>And pressing play again.</p></div></div></article><div><div><div><a href=https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/pinga-ferramenta-cli-para-requisicao-http/>&#8592; Pinga: minha pequena ferramenta para requisições http</a>
