Dark rooms lit by the cold glow of a CRT monitor.
The light of the modem blinking like a lighthouse in the silent dawn.
No one around. Just me and some band screaming things I barely understood — but deeply felt.
It wasn’t sadness. It was solitude.
But it was mine. Tamed, familiar.
I learned to talk to it when the rest of the world only wanted noise."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/the-places-i-never-returned-to/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://adlermedrado.com.br/images/default-og-image.png"><title>The Places I Never Returned To, But Still Live in Me</title>
