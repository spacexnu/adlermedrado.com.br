Just me and some band screaming things I barely understood — but deeply felt.</p><p>It wasn’t sadness. It was solitude.<br>But it was mine. Tamed, familiar.<br>I learned to talk to it when the rest of the world only wanted noise.</p><p>While the world slept, I was digging digital tunnels, searching for others like me.<br>And I found them.<br>I never saw their faces.<br>But they were awake at 3AM too.<br>And that was enough.</p><p>I don’t speak of those places with naive nostalgia.<br>I don’t want to go back.<br>But some nights, everything I am today feels like it was born there — in silence, in isolation, in the absence of applause.</p><p>There, I learned not to wait for anyone.<br>Not to need an audience.<br>To trust my own hands, my own eyes, and what I could build even when the world seemed to laugh behind my back.</p><p>A lot has changed.<br>Now there are people around, responsibilities, bills, meetings, obligations.<br>But sometimes I look at the computer screen, and for a few seconds, that room returns.</p><p>It’s not physical.<br>It’s encoded memory.<br>An invisible tattoo on how I think, how I live, how I continue.</p><p>Today I walk between code, ideas, silence and purpose.<br>I carry with me fragments of those places that built me when no one was watching.<br>I still prefer the corner of the room. I still talk more to myself than to others.<br>But now, I know the value of it all.</p><p>Some people learn in school.<br>Some learn with applause.<br>I learned in the void.</p><p>And in that void, I realized the world didn’t need to understand me.<br>I just had to keep going.</p></div></div></article><div><div><div><a href=https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/automating_job_search_with_ai_powered_analysis/>&#8592; Job Finder - Automating job search with AI powered analysis</a>
