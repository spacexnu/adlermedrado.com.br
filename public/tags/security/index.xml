&lt;p>I’m only able to work on FraudTalon a few hours per week, but I’m committed to making steady progress and sharing weekly updates.0&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting today, you can upload &lt;code>.eml&lt;/code> files directly through the interface, and the system will run a complete analysis
using a combination of email security heuristics and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p>
&lt;img alt="fraudtalon-banner" height="50%" src="https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/images/fraudtalon-banner.png" width="50%"/>
&lt;p>The pipeline now works like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Automatic &lt;code>.eml&lt;/code> parsing with extraction of headers, sender, recipient, subject, and body&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heuristic evaluation with signals such as:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mismatch between From, Reply-To, and Return-Path&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authentication failures (DKIM, SPF, DMARC)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Relaying through unknown servers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AI analysis (via OpenAI) that takes into account the full textual content&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Final score with a breakdown of suspicious indicators&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This update makes &lt;a href="https://fraudtalon.com">FraudTalon&lt;/a> a much more powerful tool for analyzing suspicious emails like
phishing, Pix scams, or fake investment offers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fighting online fraud with FraudTalon</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/fraudtalon-mvp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:24:49 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/fraudtalon-mvp/</guid><description>&lt;p>After getting so many messages from my parents, wife, sister, and friends asking if emails or ads they saw on social media were legit, I decided to build a tool to help identify fraud, scams, and phishing attempts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how &lt;a href="https://fraudtalon.com">&lt;strong>FraudTalon&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> was born.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s currently in MVP version &lt;strong>0.0.1&lt;/strong> — basic functionality, simple heuristics (I started with NLP but dropped it — not needed for now), and a single cloud-based LLM. The goal at this stage is to validate the idea.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building My Own Sovereign RAG for Secure Code Analysis</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/sovereign-rag/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 14:59:31 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/sovereign-rag/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="building-my-own-sovereign-rag-for-secure-code-analysis">Building My Own Sovereign RAG for Secure Code Analysis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lately, I’ve been taking a closer look at some code analysis tools that claim to detect security vulnerabilities in software projects. The idea itself is solid. I got one of these tools recommended to me and decided to dig deeper to see what’s really behind these solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty quickly I noticed a pattern: these platforms are far from cheap. Some offer limited free plans, but we all know how this game works. When something that good is offered for “free”, the real price usually comes from somewhere else — data collection, vendor lock-in, black-box models processing your code in someone else’s cloud. And since I’ve been deeply studying AI lately, especially Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the question came naturally: why not build my own pipeline, fully local, sovereign, using open-source tools, running on my own machine, and depending on no one?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MDN Report A+</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/missives/mdn-report-a-/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 21:44:46 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/missives/mdn-report-a-/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://adlermedrado.com.br/missives/images/badge-aplus.png" alt="MDN A+ badge">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ran my site through &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN&lt;/a>’s security scanner and kept tweaking until I hit &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/analyze?host=adlermedrado.com.br">120/100 (A+)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Checked the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/analyze?host=adlermedrado.com.br#history">scan history&lt;/a> and the very first one, back in 2018, scored 20/100 (F).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Always improving.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Real-time Deepfakes: what if "seeing is believing" no longer means anything?</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/deepfakes_realtime/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 11:19:13 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/deepfakes_realtime/</guid><description>&lt;p>An open-source project called Deep-Live-Cam is gaining traction on GitHub — and for good reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With just a single still image, it can mimic anyone’s face in a live video call. In real-time. Running locally. No cloud required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implication is clear: you can no longer trust a video call at face value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here’s the question: &lt;strong>how do we verify identity in a world where faces can be forged on demand?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why You Should Start Using GPG Now</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/gpg-intro-en/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/gpg-intro-en/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-you-should-start-using-gpg-now">Why You Should Start Using GPG Now&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not using GPG to sign or encrypt your files and messages yet, it&amp;rsquo;s time to reconsider. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about looking like a 90s movie hacker — it&amp;rsquo;s about protecting your communication and digital identity in an increasingly hostile world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-is-gpg">🔐 What is GPG?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a free implementation of the OpenPGP standard. It allows you to create cryptographic key pairs to digitally sign files and messages, as well as encrypt them to ensure confidentiality. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential tool for anyone serious about digital security.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadowdata Updates</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/shadowdata-updates/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 15:53:53 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/shadowdata-updates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/shadowdata-sensitive-data-handler/">I published a blog&lt;/a> post introducing my new open-source project, ShadowData.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is just to inform anyone interested that I have made some updates today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New Features Added to the Project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Email address anonymization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Phone number anonymization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Symmetric cryptography for encryption and decryption&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Minor improvements to tests and code quality&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can look the code at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/adlermedrado/ShadowData/">Github repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadowdata Sensitive Data Handler Python Library</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/shadowdata-sensitive-data-handler/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 21:23:34 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/shadowdata-sensitive-data-handler/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am deeply concerned about how to handle sensitive data in the projects I work on. Nowadays, there are laws in various countries addressing this issue, and the topic becomes increasingly important as time goes on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, I decided to create a Python library that can help me deal with scenarios where it is necessary to process data to prevent any individual from being identified if the information is accessed. The library also handles data transformations, encryption, and the detection of sensitive personal data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sudo with Touch ID on macOS</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/sudo-touch-id/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 20:03:28 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/sudo-touch-id/</guid><description>&lt;p>Setting up sudo for use with Touch ID on macOS Sonoma in just a few steps is very easy.&lt;/p>
