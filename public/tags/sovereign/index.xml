&lt;p&gt;After being suspended without warning, my account on X was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson stays the same: if you rely only on centralized platforms, you are always one click away from being erased.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>They suspended my X account</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/missives/they-suspended-my-x-account/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:11:03 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/missives/they-suspended-my-x-account/</guid><description>&lt;img alt="x-email-about-suspending-my-account-in-pt-br" height="50%" src="https://adlermedrado.com.br/missives/images/x-blocked.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account from 2006. Almost 1200 followers. GONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No clear reason. just “violated authenticity rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn’t insult anyone. Didn’t spread fake news. Just posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They threatened to block any new account I create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how dumb it is to rely on centralized platforms?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building My Own Sovereign RAG for Secure Code Analysis</title><link>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/sovereign-rag/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 14:59:31 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/sovereign-rag/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="building-my-own-sovereign-rag-for-secure-code-analysis"&gt;Building My Own Sovereign RAG for Secure Code Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been taking a closer look at some code analysis tools that claim to detect security vulnerabilities in software projects. The idea itself is solid. I got one of these tools recommended to me and decided to dig deeper to see what’s really behind these solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty quickly I noticed a pattern: these platforms are far from cheap. Some offer limited free plans, but we all know how this game works. When something that good is offered for “free”, the real price usually comes from somewhere else — data collection, vendor lock-in, black-box models processing your code in someone else’s cloud. And since I’ve been deeply studying AI lately, especially Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the question came naturally: why not build my own pipeline, fully local, sovereign, using open-source tools, running on my own machine, and depending on no one?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
