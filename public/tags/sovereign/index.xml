&lt;p>Lately, I’ve been taking a closer look at some code analysis tools that claim to detect security vulnerabilities in software projects. The idea itself is solid. I got one of these tools recommended to me and decided to dig deeper to see what’s really behind these solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty quickly I noticed a pattern: these platforms are far from cheap. Some offer limited free plans, but we all know how this game works. When something that good is offered for “free”, the real price usually comes from somewhere else — data collection, vendor lock-in, black-box models processing your code in someone else’s cloud. And since I’ve been deeply studying AI lately, especially Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the question came naturally: why not build my own pipeline, fully local, sovereign, using open-source tools, running on my own machine, and depending on no one?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
